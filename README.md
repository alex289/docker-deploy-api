Let's say you build a Docker image for your application using a CI/CD pipeline and upload the image to a Docker registry.
But how do you update the running containers on your servers with the new image? You can use Docker Deploy API to do that.

## Features

-   Pull new image and recreate container, or only recreate or restart a container
-   Update multiple containers at once 🔄️
-   Clean up old images 🧹
-   Works with private Docker registries 🔒
-   No need to give your CI/CD pipeline SSH access to your servers 🛡️
-   Works without any database
-   Support for nearly any CI/CD pipeline, e.g. GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.

## Installation 🚀

> [!TIP]
> You can find all information about the installation, configuration and usage in the [documentation](https://deploy-api.tkoessler.de).

The easiest way to set up Docker Deploy API is to use the provied [docker-compose](https://github.com/timokoessler/docker-deploy-api/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file.

## How it works

Docker Deploy API is a HTTP API that you can call from your CI/CD pipeline. The request contains a deploy token that you can generate using the CLI tool.
This token is used to authenticate the request and contains the configuration for the deployment.
For convenience, there is a bash script that you can use in your CI/CD pipeline for sending the request.

## GitHub Actions example

The following example shows how to use Docker Deploy API in a GitHub Actions workflow using the helper bash script that is hosted by every instance of Docker Deploy API.

```yaml
- name: Deploy 🚀
  run: curl -sSL "https://deploy.example.com/s" | bash -s -- "${{ secrets.DEPLOY_TOKEN }}"
```

In the [documentation](https://deploy-api.tkoessler.de) you can find examples for other CI/CD pipelines. You can also start the deployment by simply calling the HTTP API with any tool of your choice.
